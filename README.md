  *Strategic business simulation game*
  <br><br>
  With focus on realistic business management, players make critical decisions, adapt to market dynamics, and strive to outsmart competitors.
  By mastering the art of entrepreneurship, players can rise to the top, conquer industries, and leave a lasting legacy in the world of business.

  <br><br>
  *Neuronal network evolution simulation using DNA*
  <br><br>
  This is a simulation of evolution that focuses on DNA, neural networks, and the process of evolution.
  The entities in the simulation represent individuals in a population.
  Each entity has a DNA string that encodes the properties of its neural network.

  Through a process of evolution, the entities' DNA undergoes mutation and selection.
  Random changes occur in the DNA string, resulting in variations in the properties of the neural networks.
  The entities that possess neural networks better adapted to the environment, such as being efficient at finding and consuming food,
  are more likely to survive and reproduce. This leads to the propagation of beneficial traits in the population over successive generations.

  The simulation provides a way to observe and study the effects of genetic variation, neural network architecture,
  and selective pressures on the behavior and adaptation of the entities. It serves as a simplified model of how DNA, neural networks,
  and evolution can interact to shape the characteristics and behavior of living organisms.
