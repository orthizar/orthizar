This collection primarily consists of experiments and ongoing projects. To help you navigate efficiently, I have compiled a list of notable projects worth your attention.

- [**orthizar/rosalind**](https://github.com/orthizar/rosalind)
  <br><br>
  _Common solutions for bioinformatics problems on Rosalind_
  <br><br>
  [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/about) is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving.

  This repository contains my solutions for a diverse range of bioinformatics problems on Rosalind, along with explanations in individual README files.

- [**orthizar/health**](https://github.com/orthizar/health)
  <br><br>
  _Health of Silvan Kohler_
  <br><br>
  Visit [health.silvankohler.swiss](https://health.silvankohler.swiss) to monitor my essential health indicators, including glucose levels, heart rate, SpO2 (oxygen saturation), and respiration rate.
  This project is dedicated to promoting proactive health management and offers a public-facing API that empowers developers to create their own applications using real-time sample data for a wide range of health metrics.
  <br><br>
- [**orthizar/evolution**](https://github.com/orthizar/evolution)
  <br><br>
  _Neuronal network evolution simulation using DNA_
  <br><br>
  This is a simulation of evolution that focuses on DNA, neural networks, and the process of evolution.
  The entities in the simulation represent individuals in a population.
  Each entity has a DNA string that encodes the properties of its neural network.

  Through a process of evolution, the entities' DNA undergoes mutation and selection.
  Random changes occur in the DNA string, resulting in variations in the properties of the neural networks.
  The entities that possess neural networks better adapted to the environment, such as being efficient at finding and consuming food,
  are more likely to survive and reproduce. This leads to the propagation of beneficial traits in the population over successive generations.

  The simulation provides a way to observe and study the effects of genetic variation, neural network architecture,
  and selective pressures on the behavior and adaptation of the entities. It serves as a simplified model of how DNA, neural networks,
  and evolution can interact to shape the characteristics and behavior of living organisms.
